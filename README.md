# pShape

A lightweight JavaScript library for creating and animating customizable polygonal shapes on an HTML canvas.

## Examples

## Usage

To create a new animated polygon shape, instantiate a `pShape` object by passing a canvas element ID and an options object.

```js
new pShape(('myCanvas', {
    radius: 80,
    thickness: 20,
    number_of_sides: 14,
    speed_x: 2,
    speed_y: 0.25,
    top_fill: './coin-a.png',
    bottom_fill: './coin-b.png',
    side_fills: ['silver']
};
```
